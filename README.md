# Haskell exercises

## 1. Find scary words {`scary`}

If you assign numbers to letters (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), then a word is scary if the sum of its letters is 26. “baaed”, for instance, is scary (especially when at first you don't understand it's a silly verb and think it's an ancient god's name).

Find all scary words in the `words` file (it's usually in `/usr/share/dict/words` or `/usr/dict/words`). If you're on Windows, you can [download it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eneko/data-repository/master/data/words.txt).

## 2. Calculate probability of winning using simulation {`reposts`}

There's a contest going on in a Russian social network: seven prizes will be given to seven randomly chosen people among those who have reposted a certain post. (There are actually 100 prizes, but the other 93 suck, so we'll ignore them.) There are already ~1000000 reposts. My sister wonders: what's the probability of her winning at least one prize (out of those seven) if she reposts the post 10 times (from different accounts)? What about 100 times? 1000 times?

Calculate the answer by running a simulation some number of times (for instance, 10000 times). You can use [`System.Random`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/random/docs/System-Random.html) or some other random library (e.g. [`Data.Random`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/random-fu/docs/Data-Random.html)).

A code-free spoiler: if you're not good at probabilistic simulations, <a href="#" title="You can assume that prizes go to people with numbers 1–7, then generate N random numbers between 1 and 1000000+N and check that at least one of them is between 1 and 7. Make sure that generated numbers aren't equal."> here's one way it could be done</a> (answer in the link tooltip).

## 3. Write a tic-tac-toe game {`tictactoe`}

Here's a sample log that the player should see (Github might be rendering box characters weirdly but they will look okay in terminal):

~~~
Who goes first? (human/computer)?
> h

  A B C
 ┏━┯━┯━┓
1┃ │ │ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
2┃ │ │ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
3┃ │ │ ┃
 ┗━┷━┷━┛

Your move:
> A1

  A B C
 ┏━┯━┯━┓
1┃X│ │ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
2┃ │O│ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
3┃ │ │ ┃
 ┗━┷━┷━┛

Your move:
> B2

This cell is already taken!

Your move:
> B1

  A B C
 ┏━┯━┯━┓
1┃X│X│O┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
2┃ │O│ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
3┃ │ │ ┃
 ┗━┷━┷━┛

Your move:
> A2

  A B C
 ┏━┯━┯━┓
1┃X│X│O┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
2┃X│O│ ┃
 ┠─┼─┼─┨
3┃O│ │ ┃
 ┗━┷━┷━┛

Computer won.
~~~

Use [ansi-terminal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal) to:

* Color computer's chips red and human's – green.
* Make the winning sequence stand out when the game ends (by changing the background color instead of the foreground color).

## 4. Generate a maze using Wilson's algorithm {`wilson`}

The description of the algorithm is quite accessible: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm. Don't try to make it fast – if it can find a 15×15 maze, it's good enough.

Here's a sample 10×10 maze:

```
 ___________________

| | | | | | |_|_   _|
| |  _|_|_   ___   _|
|  _   ___|  _|_  | |
|  _|_    |   | |_  |
|     |_|_|_| | | |_|
|_| |  _|_  |___   _|
| | |  _    | |  ___|

|___|_____|_________|

```
